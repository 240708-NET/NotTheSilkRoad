# NotTheSilkRoad
This is the repository for P3 Team 2.


# Description:
This application is a basic online marketplace where users can create accounts and purchase products. The platform will dynamically update product availability as items are sold, and offers search functionality to help users find specific items. Each product listing can be clicked to view detailed information and images, and includes a "Buy Now" button for easy purchase.

# While running the links to the Deployed frontend and api are as follows:
API: notthesilkroadapi.azurewebsites.net


FrontEnd: notthesilkroadfront.azurewebsites.net


# For running on local machines: 
Ensure you are in the "FrontEnd-DevBranch" and you must have the api running from within the API directory of the Dev branch via 'dotnet run' and then once the API is running, you may open another terminal and proceed to the front-end directory within the upper Frontend directory within Dev and run 'npm install' to gather your dependencies, then 'npm run dev' and the program should spin up and work as intended.
